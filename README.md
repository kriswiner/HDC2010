# HDC2010
Low-Power Digital Temperature and Humidity Sensor

Basic Arduino sketch showing methods to configure TI's [HDC2010](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/hdc2010.pdf) temperature and humidity sensor, configure the data ready interrupt, read and properly scale the data and output to the serial monitor. The sketch is designed to easily allow multiple HDC2010 to operate on the same I2C bus.
